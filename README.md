# Region of Interest Identification in Photodiode Data

This code implements identifaction for Regions of Interest (ROIs) in photodiode
output data from atom interferometers used for quantum gravity gradiometry.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `pip intall .` from within the top-level
directory.

## Usage

Make a directory named `output` inside the directory where you will run the
pacakage.  Run with `python -m qggroi <path/to/dbfile>`.
